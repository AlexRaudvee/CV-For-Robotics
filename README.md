# Computer Vision For Robotics

### Repository Description

Welcome to the Computer Vision For Robotics repository! This project is sponsored by the Gaia Student Team and focuses on developing advanced computer vision (CV) solutions for robotics, specifically designed for trash collection tasks.

### Project Overview
Our team is dedicated to enhancing the capabilities of a four-wheel robot, engineered to clean beaches. The primary goal is to improve the robot's visual perception and decision-making processes, enabling it to identify, locate, and collect trash efficiently.

### Key Objectives
1. **Advanced Computer Vision Techniques:** Implement and optimize state-of-the-art CV algorithms to detect various types of trash in diverse beach environments.
2. **Real-time Processing:** Ensure the robot can process visual data in real-time, making quick and accurate decisions.
3. **Autonomous Navigation:** Integrate CV with autonomous navigation systems, allowing the robot to move around obstacles and navigate different terrains effectively.
4. **Robustness and Reliability:** Develop solutions that are robust against varying lighting conditions, weather changes, and the presence of other objects or people on the beach.
